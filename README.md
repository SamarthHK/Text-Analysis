# Text-Analysis
A project where me and my friend Matyas Ryhmes work on a python project. This project is a text analysis using TextBlob a NLP library in python. The way this works, is by taking a sentence as input, checking if its valid, then outputting a analysis. From this project we will learn to deepen our understanding in python and use of NLP.
